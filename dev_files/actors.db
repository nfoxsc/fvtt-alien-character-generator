Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it.

However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

Its interior is equipped with a tactical command center with links to each soldier's helmet cams and biosigns. The exterior is armored with a laser absorbent paint job. In addition to chaff launchers and a small front mounted turret, the M570 mounts a rotating main weapons package on a rail system that allows it to slide back and store in the rear of the vehicle when not in use, thus lowering the APC's profile and heat signature. The air pressure in its large, armored wheels is controlled by the driver in order to facilitate better traction over soft terrain and allow the vehicle's chassis some additional clearance over rough ground-its low profile is perhaps the APC's biggest weakness.

Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\n\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient-and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period-the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"4","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>The alien grows within the host animal's chest, reaching a point of maturity where it is no longer dependent on the host for survival.

While some still linger, most radiation zones from past conflicts have been cleaned up and pose little threat. Earth is far from a safe place to live, however. The United States Oil Wars have taken their toll on North America. The recent Australian Rebellion against the 3WE was ended swiftly with the nuclear strike on the Outback’s capital, Canberra. The cost of living on Earth is extravagant, and those who aren't rich are confined to metropolitan ghettoes.

Heavy mining stations like the one on Io and orbital colonial stations like those around Saturn and Jupiter lace the moons and planets throughout the solar system.\n\nMARS: Along with Earth and Titan, Mars is one of the three capital worlds of the Three World Empire. Valles Colony on Mars was the former headquarters\nof Weyland Corp before they merged with Yutani. Terraforming has made the planet home for over 20 million colonists.

The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient-and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period-the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"4","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>The alien grows within the host animal's chest, reaching a point of maturity where it is no longer dependent on the host for survival.

Never one to miss a beat, Weyland-Yutani converted the worksite to a Class C Work Correctional Unit and lead works for radioactive and toxic waste disposal, leasing it to the Three World Empire.

Rumors suggest it was a rare strain of Cholera. Whatever it was, the convicts stationed there made unauthorized use of the facility's stores of quinitricetyline in an attempt to burn away the infectious agent,  accidentally killing several of their own in the process. Weyland-Yutani dispatched the Medical frigate Patna to Fury 161 but were too late to save all but one\r\ninmate—Robert Morse.\r\nThe story has been sensationalized by Morse’s banned book Space Beast, in which he claims that it wasn’t a contagion but a hostile organism that was on board the EEV, and that it slew nearly everyone before it was finally put down.

During the day, the outpost unfurls a solar shield to both protect it from the direct heat and to harness the star’s rays and recharge its power cells. A “day” on\r\n17 Phei Phei E lasts nearly two Earth months while a “night” lasts about 28 Earth days. Supply ships can only approach when the outpost is on the nightside, as the planetoid itself shields the transports from the extreme heat of the sun.\r\nAssignment to Znoy is considered a punishment. \r\nIt is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area. While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations. To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley’s Hope.

If it fails, the egg will open and release a Facehugger. An Ovomorph can release its Facehugger even at Short Range-roll a Stress Dice each Round. On a Failure, the Facehugger is released.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: If you shoot an egg with a rifle, the bullet is likely to deflect off its rubbery hide. Fire is a proven method of sterilizing them, and explosives do the trick as well. Keep in mind that the eggs are essentially vats of acid, and when exploding will cause acid damage accordingly. Extremem cold can make an egg dormant.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"5","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>Large leathery objects, Ovomorphs are the beginning of the alien life cycle. They come in various sizes from 0.6 to 1.2 meters tall. While most open with four petals at the top, some only have a single slit that opens to reveal the Facehugger it carries within.

If it makes an attack that causes damage it will immediately make a second attack (with eight Base Dice, Damage 1) against the same target as a free action.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Stage IV Xenos are notoriously difficult to kill. They operate outside of the alien hive mind ad are independent-but each exhibits traits that can be exploited. Stalkers and Scouts can be tricked into running into a hazardous situation. Drones are a bit smarter, but they follow a routine and spend most of their time hibernating in warm places such as somehwere close to a reactor core-and can be hunted down accordingly.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"8","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>Now young adults, Stage IV Xenos are able to adapte a bipedal stance, even though they might not always make use of it.

In addition to their metallic, toothy mouths, they have an inner set of jaws that can strike like a piston-a favored mode of attack.</p>\n<p>Save for the Scout, Stage IV Xenomorphs have four dorsal tubes affixed to their backs. While some have theorized the tubes are used for spinning and cocooning the resin for their hive, that has generally been discounted as a fallacy. The current line of thinking is that the tubes are a type of breathing apparatus, filtering out airborne toxins and allowing the creatures to breathe underwater.

Their immense size and crested carapaces mark them as the leaders of their hive. Stronger and smarter than those beneath them, Stage VI Xenos command alien armies. These Stages are only reached when an existing Queen produces royal jelly and exposes her Soldiers and Sentries to it.</p>\n<p>The mother of the hive, at six meters tall or more, the alien Queen is perhaps the strongest and most intelligent of the species. While any adult alien is capable of initiating ovomorphing in a host organsim, only Queens have the ability to lay eggs en masse. When her first molt is completed and the Queen is fertile, her Workers spin a resin cradle that holds her suspended above the floor of the hive. The Queen then grows an enormous egg sac that soon becomes distended and engorged with developing eggs. As each new Ovomorph is ready, she deposits it on the ground via ovipositor for her Workers to spirit away to nearby cocooned hosts.</p>\n<p>The most astonishing thing about the Queen is her ability to communicate with her hive. While evidence exists to suggest she does so via a combination of pheromones and subsonic vocalizations, there are company consultants who believe she communicates telepathically as well, \"speaking\" with her children over immeasurable distances. In face, corporate psychiatrists have documented that employees who score high on their company esper tests and find themselves within the proximity of an alien hive will have vivid dreams of the Queen calling to them, whether they are aware of her existence or not.</p>\n<p>Additionally, professional dreamers seem to have a hard time producing after being exposed to an alien Queen. Of course, this could simply be a form of PTSD, but it bears further investigation.

While true gunships like the Tomahawk are more heavily armed and strike ships like the Cougar and Bearcat are more manoeuvrable, none have the versatility of the Cheyenne. The Cheyenne are dropped from orbit into the fray from the ventral bay of any USCMC frigate or carrier, swiftly descending through the atmosphere like a meteor. The current model has been specifically augmented to carry the M577 into a combat zone, deploy the APC and its marine squad, and immediately assume an air support role for the squad. The ship is mostly transport bay with cockpit, weapons systems, and engines attached-there is little in the way of other accommodations aboard. While in supersonic decent, the Cheyenne's weapons pods are retracted flush with its hull. These pods deploy for subsonic combat. With a proper satellite uplink, the Cheyenne is capable of being flown by remote from a portable terminal. Few pilots have the skill necessary for this manoeuvre, and the task is usually left to the squad's android XO. \n\nLength: 25.2m. \nStandard Armament: \n    25mm Gatling Gun, \n    Mk.16 150mm Banshee 70 Unguided Rocket Launcher, \n    7 x AGM-220C Hellhound II Tactical Missiles, \n    3 x AIM-90E Headlock Air-to-Air Missiles.","label":"Text"},"hull":{"value":10,"label":"Number","max":10},"passengers":{"value":15,"label":"Number"},"speed":{"value":4,"label":"Number"},"manoeuvrability":{"value":2,"label":"Number"}},"modifiers":{"gunnerName":null,"rangedCbt":{"value":0,"label":"Ranged Combat","ability":"agl"},"pilotName":null,"piloting":{"value":0,"label":"Piloting","ability":"agl"}},"general":{"misc":{"value":""}},"notes":{"notes":""},"crew":{"occupants":[],"passengerQty":0}},"ownership":{"default":0,"QKKAD0kWDfGCQDcy":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"H5UgzpFc3Xvp8xLJ":3,"KTgXQYOvdxaGdceE":3,"3eAStCv0v21fqZVU":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"UD-4L Cheyenne VTOL Dropship","displayName":20,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"None"},"bar2":{"attribute":"None"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/alienrpg-corerules/images/icons/ud-4-dropship.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"alienrpg","systemVersion":"3.0.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661954249731,"modifiedTime":1674623626976,"lastModifiedBy":"3eAStCv0v21fqZVU"}}

The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier's carapace is armored enough to shurg off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you'll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive. Period.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"6","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>As the hive mind takes a hold of them at Stage V of their development, P. praepotens molt to assume specialized roles within their community.</p>\n<p>The diminutive Workers build and maintain the hive.&nbsp; Also called Weavers, they produce and spin the resin of the hive with their long proboscis tongues, shape it with their hands and feet, position eggs near cocooned hosts, and feed and maintain the Queeen.

Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\n\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"10","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Known by a variety of names, the horrifically bizarre alien Xenomorph XX121 is an endoparasitic<br>lifeform with a unique life cycle.

Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nEmbryo Implantation: Weyland-Yutani surgical scientist Dr. Matshulta believes that a Facehugger deposits a Chestburster embryo within its victim, making them the same species. Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\n\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"5","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xenomorph designed for one task only-the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacks, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host's face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature's throat. There are several different Facehugger types which appear to vary only slightly in appearance. Thee major difference is the type of seed they carry-be it for a Praetomorph, Xenomorph Drone, or Queen.</p>\n<p>The royal variety of Facehugger has eight webbed fingers and is much larger than the standard type. Armored, it also possesses two serrated fingertips and bladed tail with which to defend itself. Some specimens have also been known to have spikes on their back and spots on their air bladders. While it is theorized that a regular Facehugger can produce a P. praepotens with the ability to transmute into a Queen if necessary, the larger and more powerful Royal Facehuggers are known to specifically produce Queens, and hypothesized to carry not one but two P. praepotens spores-allowing the royal Facehugger to not only produce a Queen, but also a protector for the newborn royalty.</p>","rTables":"Facehugger Attacks","cTables":"None"},"ownership":{"default":0,"lS61ysx9qdaPA2WY":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"H5UgzpFc3Xvp8xLJ":3,"KTgXQYOvdxaGdceE":3,"3eAStCv0v21fqZVU":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Royal Facehugger (Stage II Xenomorph)","displayName":20,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"header.health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"None"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/alienrpg-corerules/images/tokens/fh2-token.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"alienrpg","systemVersion":"3.0.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661954249685,"modifiedTime":1674623626799,"lastModifiedBy":"3eAStCv0v21fqZVU"}}

While they have few weaknesses, taking out a Praetorian will temporarily  disorient the Soldiers it coordinates. As for dealing with the Queen... yeah. Don't.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nEmbryo Implantation: Weyland-Yutani surgical scientist Dr. Matshulta believes that a Facehugger deposits a Chestburster embryo within its victim, making them the same species. Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\n\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"4","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xenomorph designed for one task only-the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacks, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host's face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature's throat.

The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV.\n\nContainment and Termination Protocol: Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient-and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period-the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"4","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>The alien grows within the host animal's chest, reaching a point of maturity where it is no longer dependent on the host for survival.

However, as Aliens have been observed surviving the vacuum of space, it is possible that they do not need to breathe at all.</p>\n<p>Sometimes called Lurkers, Drones stand 2.4 meters tall, and are stealthy ambush hunters.

The stealthy creatures' fluid yet awkward movements and unorthodox reactions to stimuli belie their methodical intelligence. As much as a Stalker acts like a feral animal, a Drone plots. The ebon Drone is a clever yet single-minded iteration of the Xenomorph. Development of P. praepotens will arrest at Stage IV unless a Queen's pheromones cause it to molt into a Worker or Soldier-whichever form the hive is most in need of.

In 2122, the USCSS Nostromo touched down on LV-426 in response to an unknown distress call, allegedly encountering a hostile alien life form that eventually led to the ship’s destruction at the hands of one of the crew. However, when the moon was extensively surveyed in the 2130s, it was discovered that it had no indigenous life, calling the Nostromo rumors into question.\r\nLV-426 is perhaps best known as the site of the doomed colony Hadley’s Hope. Thirty-five years after the Nostromo incident, Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial dministration set up an atmospheric processor on the swiftly turning moon and began terraforming procedures. The moon was renamed Acheron by its early settlers, and Hadley’s Hope\r\nendured there for more than twenty years. The colony stopped transmitting reports in July of 2179, prompting a visit by a contingent of colonial marines. Whatever transpired next led to the nuclear annihilation of the colony and the death of\r\nboth the colonial marine unit and all 158 colonists.\r\nWhat caused the destruction is uncertain—conflicting reports range from an attack by a rival government or unknown alien species to a simple reactor accident and meltdown. All that remains is a radioactive wasteland stretching over 700 km.\r\nSoon after the incident, both Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Marines sent search and rescue teams to Acheron in the hopes of finding survivors.\r\n\r\nWhile the colony and the atmospheric processor were vaporized, it was theoretically possible that any colonists who made it as far as the Ilium Range would be protected from the blast by the mountains there. The company set up a relief station in orbit, but no survivors were ever found.

The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier's carapace is armored enough to shurg off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you'll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive. Period.\n\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\n\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\n\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\n\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\n\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\n\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\n\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\n\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"10","label":"Acid Splash"},"critInj":{"value":""}},"notes":"<p>As the hive mind takes a hold of them at Stage V of their development, P. praepotens molt to assume specialized roles within their community.</p>\n<p>After Scouts have secured a hive and a source of hosts, they mature into Sentries.
