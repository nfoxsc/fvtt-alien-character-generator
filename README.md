# fvtt-alien-character-generator

Basic Character generator for the Alien RPG game via Foundry VTT. Copy the macro code into a new macro and hit play. It's not perfect, this is my first Javascript. Its gross, I know, but it works for my needs and maybe your's too.

Three Main Macro Types:

Random_Generator_macro
  - Random between Character (Human) and Synthetic

Character_Generator_macro rename 

  - Force Character (Human) Race

Synthetic_Generaton_macro rename
  - Force Synthetic Race

To-Dos:
 - Look into adding Items and Talents into proper place within the character sheet.
     - May be needs an alternate version if installed system does not have the official modules
 - Convert into a Module with better control over options
     - Force settings like Race, Career, and maybe more
- Get better at scripting
 - Clean up Code

 NOTE:
 Names Shamelessly taken from 
- Not Enough NPCs: A 5e NPC Generator (https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTNPCGen) because ardittristan made something wonderful that made life easier and now I want that same thing for another game.

Thanks to pwatson100 for helping me get the character sheet generation working!
