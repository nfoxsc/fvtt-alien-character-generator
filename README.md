# fvtt-alien-character-generator

Basic Character generator for the Alien RPG game via Foundry VTT. Copy the macro code into a new macro and hit play. It's not perfect, this is my first Javascript. Its gross, I know, but it works for my needs and maybe your's too.

To-Dos:
 - Figure out APIs to create charater sheet (maybe, likely not..)
 - Get better at scripting
 - Clean up Code

 NOTE:
 Names Shamelessly taken from 
- Not Enough NPCs: A 5e NPC Generator (https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTNPCGen) because ardittristan made something wonderful that made life easier and now I want that same thing for another game.
